# tournamentbuildr <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" />

An R package for building and scheduling tournaments.

### Build

Build your very own tournament!

```{r}
library(tournamentbuildr)

# build a round-robin tournament
x <- Tournament$new(teams = LETTERS[1:8], type = "round_robin")

# view the schedule
x$schedule
```

### Play

Once created, you can also record the results and track progress.

```{r}
# play the first few games
x$play(game = 1, winner = "A")
x$play(game = 2, winner = "A")
x$play(game = 3, winner = "D")

# playing is chainable, cool!
x$play(4, "A")$play(5, "F")$play(6, "G")

# how do things stand now?
x$standings()
```

### Variety

Right now, you can choose from these types of tournaments:
  - round-robin (`round_robin`)
  - random-robin (`random_robin`)
  - single-elimination bracket (`bracket`)
  
Note that for the single-elimination tournament, teams are assumed to be pre-ranked and ordered from best-to-worst.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# round-robin
Tournament$new(teams = LETTERS[1:8], type = "round_robin")

# random-robin (i.e., a round-robin that's been cut short!)
Tournament$new(teams = LETTERS[1:8], type = "random_robin", n_games = 10)

# single-elimination bracket
Tournament$new(teams = LETTERS[1:8], type = "bracket")
```

### Future Work

#### Equipment/Facility/Timeslot Scheduling
  
Given some restrictions on necessary equipment and availability of facilities, how should tournament games be scheduled?

#### Additional Tournament Options

  - games with >2 teams competing (e.g., swim meet, hungry hungry hippos)
  - multiple divisions/leagues
  - double-elimination tournaments
  - capacity for customizable game attributes (e.g., goals for/against, shutouts)
